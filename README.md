## Prerequisites

### Linux
- Vulkan 1.3 capable GPU and drivers
- CMake 3.25+
- Ninja
- clang-format (for code style enforcement)
- GCC or Clang with C++23 support

On Gentoo:
```bash
sudo emerge -av cmake ninja clang dev-util/vulkan-tools
```

On Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt install cmake ninja-build clang-format vulkan-tools libvulkan-dev
```

### Windows
- CMake 3.25+
- Ninja
- Vulkan SDK from [lunarg.com](https://vulkan.lunarg.com)
- MSVC or MinGW with C++23 support

## Building

```bash
# Clone with submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/curl0z/curloz-engine.git
cd curloz-engine

# If you forgot --recursive
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Configure and build
cmake -B build/debug -G Ninja
cmake --build build/debug
```

Binary lands at `build/debug/CurlozEngine`.
