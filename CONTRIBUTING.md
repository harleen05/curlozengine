# Maintainer Guide

This document is for contributors working on Curloz Engine. Read this before writing a single line.

## General Architecture

Curloz Engine is built as a collection of independent subsystems under the clz:: namespace, each following the same lifecycle pattern: an init() to set up state, an update() that runs once per frame, and a shutdown() that tears everything down in reverse order of initialization. Ofcourse not all subsystems require special init and destruction. 

```bash
curloz-engine/
├── Renderer		# Renderer subsystem
├── Window		# Window subsystem
├── Math			# Math subsystem
└── ECS			# ECS subsystem
```

The init pattern is a linear sequence of init calls, with each subsystem initializing in dependency order. For example, the renderer subsystem depends on the window subsystem, so the window subsystem's init must be called before the renderer subsystem's init. Same is the case with shutdown.

Every subsystem shall stay decoupled from everything else, on purpose. We don't need to know about other subsystems to do our job. We just need to know how to interface with them, and get relevant data from them. For example, the renderer subsystem doesn't need to know about the ECS subsystem to render entities, but needs data about entities render component.

The main loop in main.cpp is the only place that knows about every subsystem at once, calling each one's init in dependency order at startup, update every frame, and shutdown in reverse order at the end.

Every subsystem's architecture and patterns

## Who mainting what

| Subsystem | Owner      | Scope |
|---|------------|---|
| Window | @curl0z    | Everything under **src or include/window/** |
| Renderer | @curl0z    | Everything under **src or include/renderer/** |
| Math | @curl0z | Everything under **include/math/** |
| ECS | @curl0z | Everything under **src or include/ecs/** |
| Physics | unassigned |  |
| Audio | unassigned | |

**Do not touch code outside your area without discussing it first.** If you need something from another area, ask. Don't patch it yourself.

## Dev Environment Setup

### Linux

```bash
# Clone with submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/curl0z/curloz-engine.git
cd curloz-engine

# Install deps (Gentoo)
sudo emerge -av cmake ninja clang vulkan-tools

# Install deps (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt install cmake ninja-build clang-format libvulkan-dev vulkan-tools

# Build
cmake -B build -G Ninja
cmake --build build
```

### Windows

- Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) (includes Git Bash — required)
- Install [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
- Install [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/)
- Install [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/)
- Open the repo folder in Visual Studio via **File → Open → Folder** (not Open Project)
- VS detects `CMakeLists.txt` automatically Don't use `.vcxproj` files

---

## Git Workflow

### Branches

```
main                  → always stable, always builds
feature/xxx           → new features
fix/xxx               → bug fixes
```

Never commit directly to `main`. Always branch, then PR.

```bash
# Start work
git checkout -b feature/physics-rigidbody

# Push branch
git push --set-upstream origin feature/physics-rigidbody

# Delete after merge
git branch -d feature/physics-rigidbody
git push origin --delete feature/physics-rigidbody
```

### Commit Messages

Format: `type: short description`

```
feature: added xyz feature
fix: fixed xyz bug
refactor: cleaned the messy code at xyz system/file
```

Types: `feature`, `fix`, `refactor`

No "fixed stuff". No "wip" on main. No giant commits that touch everything.

### PRs

- Every branch merge goes through a PR, even between friends
- Write what you did and why in the PR description
- At least one review before merge

---

## Code Style

- **Indentation** -> tabs, 8-wide
- **Braces** -> Allman everywhere (brace always on its own line)
- **Pointers** -> left aligned (`int* ptr`)
- **Functions** —> `camelCase`
- **Structs/Classes** —> `PascalCase`
- **Members/Variables** —> `camelCase`
- **Sub system variables** —> every variable described at sub system level must be prefixed as per the subsystem's name. For example in physics, variables must be prefixed with `ph_` etc..

Enforced by `.clang-format` and `.editorconfig` in the repo root.

### Setup (Linux)

```bash
# Install clang-format
sudo emerge -av clang  # Gentoo
sudo apt install clang-format  # Ubuntu

# Set up pre-commit hook (one time)
cp scripts/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### Setup (Windows)

clang-format is built into Visual Studio. Enable it:

Tools → Options → Text Editor → C/C++ → Code Style → Formatting → **Enable ClangFormat support** → check **Format on Save**

VS picks up `.clang-format` from the repo root automatically.

### Fix Formatting Manually

```bash
find src include -name "*.cpp" -o -name "*.hpp" | xargs clang-format -i
```

## Doxygen Comment Standards

Every file, struct, and function must be documented. Use `///` style comments.

### File Header

Every `.cpp` and `.hpp` file starts with:

```cpp
/**
 * @file PhysicsSystem.hpp
 * @author Your Name
 * @brief Brief one line description of what this file contains
 */
```
mentioning the author and a little brief about what it does.

### Structs and Classes

```cpp
/**
 * @brief Stores position, rotation and scale of an entity in world space.
 *
 * This is the handshake between the ECS and physics systems.
 * Do not modify the layout without consulting @curl0z.
 */
struct TransformComponent 
{
        glm::vec3 position; ///< World space position
        glm::quat rotation; ///< Rotation as quaternion
        glm::vec3 scale;    ///< Non-uniform scale
};
```

### Functions

```cpp
/**
 * @brief Submits a mesh for rendering this frame.
 *
 * @param data Mesh geometry and material data to submit
 * @return True if submission succeeded, false if render queue is full
 */
bool submitMesh(const MeshSubmitData& data);
```

### Enum

```cpp
/**
 * @brief Describes the current state of the physics body.
 */
enum class BodyState
{
        Active,   ///< Body is being simulated
        Sleeping, ///< Body has come to rest
        Static    ///< Body never moves
};
```

### Quick Reference

| Tag | Use |
|---|---|
| `@file` | File name |
| `@author` | Who wrote it |
| `@brief` | One line summary |
| `@param` | Function parameter |
| `@return` | Return value |
| `@note` | Extra info |
| `@warning` | Something that can go wrong |
| `@todo` | Planned work |

## Doxygen Docs

Docs are **not committed to the repo**. If you want to view the docs, you need to generate them locally via doxxygen.

To generate locally:

```bash
doxygen Doxyfile
```

Output goes to `docs/` which is in `.gitignore`. Do not commit it.
